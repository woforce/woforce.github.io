I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the ***Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)***, majoring in Internet of Things. Meanwhile, I am an incoming master's student at the ***Tsinghua University (THU)***, where I will pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with a broader enthusiasm for intelligent systems and multi-modal reasoning.
